# CSC488H1S Winter 2016 Assignment 1 - Team 11

Total: **98/100**

## Packaging
 * Correctly named tarball and source programs
 * Excellent approach of having all team members work with the entirety of the source language; this clearly contributed to your excellent results


## A1a.488 (20/20)

 * Program uses all arithmetic, logical and comparison operators
 * Later, don't forget to test equality/inequality comparison for both boolean and integer values
 * Later, don't forget to test a (?:) conditional expression that returns integers


## A1b.488 (20/20)

 * Program uses arrays and includes all forms of array declarations (1D and 2D, positive and negative bounds)


## A1c.488 (18/20)

 * Program uses each form of loop building, and demonstrates loop exit constructs for `while` loops
 * (**-2**) Missing any loop exit construct tests using a `repeat` loop


## A1d.488 (20/20)

 * Program declares and uses non-recursive functions and procedures, both with and without parameters


## A1e.488 (20/20)

 * Program uses recursive functions and procedures, with and without parameters, including at least one nested procedure and one nested function declaration
 * Beware of re-declaring the function `fact` and procedure `decrease` each a second time with a different signatures; the source language does _not_ support this kind of name overloading
